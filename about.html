                <p>Hi I'm Xian, an aspiring full-stack web developer from melbourne, 
                with a love for code, cofee and colour.</p>

                <p>A natural storyteller and maker, I thrive when pushed to think out of the box and am happiest
                when I'm creating or immersing myself in indeas and worlds of my own making, whether it be
                writing fiction, playing DnD or creating coffee art.</p>

                <p>I take my work seriously, but not myself, letting the results speak for themselves.
                A good day is when I've achieved a lot from working hard at work worth doing.</p> 

                <p>In my spare time, you'll find me curing boredom with board games, or jamming out to synthy 80s'
                beats and so-bad-it's-good pop.</p></div>
